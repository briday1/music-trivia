# Bingo Game Examples

This document shows examples of the bingo cards and operator reference sheet generated by the Spotify Playlist Bingo Game Generator.

## PDF Output Format

The app now generates a **complete PDF** containing all bingo cards and the operator reference sheet, ready for printing.

### Print-Optimized 2x2 Layout

The PDF is optimized for printing with **4 cards per page** in a 2x2 grid layout. This ensures:
- **Improved readability** with larger fonts (10pt for song titles, 12pt for FREE SPACE)
- **Better space utilization** with reduced margins (0.25 inch on all sides)
- **Easy printing** - simply print the PDF at 100% scale on letter-size paper
- **Less paper waste** - 4 cards per page instead of 1

### Bingo Card with Title and Free Space

Each bingo card features:
- **Optional custom title** at the top (e.g., "Music Bingo Night")
- **No B-I-N-G-O header** - clean, modern design
- **FREE SPACE in the center** with either text or an uploaded logo
- **Larger, more readable font sizes** for better visibility when printed
- **Card index at bottom** (e.g., "Card #1")
- **5x5 grid** (configurable from 3x3 to 7x7)

   - The PDF is pre-formatted with 4 cards per page in a 2x2 grid
   - No need to use "multiple pages per sheet" settings - it's already optimized!
   - Simply use standard print settings
3. **Cut the cards** along the margins between the 4 cards on each page (optional)

5. Keep the operator reference sheet for yourself to manage the game

## Printing Tips

**For Best Results:**
- Print at 100% scale (no scaling/shrinking)
- Use letter-size paper (8.5" x 11")
- The 2x2 layout uses 0.25" margins, which are safe for most printers
- Each card is approximately 3.5" x 3.5", providing good readability
- Font sizes have been optimized for clear visibility after printing

## Game Flow Example

Based on the example above:

1. **Round 12**: Card #9 wins 1st place with Row 3 when "Imagine - John Lennon" is called
2. **Round 13**: Card #2 wins 2nd place with Column 4 when "Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin" is called
3. **Round 14**: Card #5 wins 3rd place with Diagonal (TR-BL) when "One - U2" is called
4. Remaining cards continue winning through Round 22

## Notes

- The game simulation uses random song ordering, so each generation will produce different results
- Win detection works for:
  - All 5 rows
  - All 5 columns
  - Both diagonals (top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left)
- The operator table can be downloaded as CSV for printing or sharing
- Each card is guaranteed to be unique with different song arrangements
