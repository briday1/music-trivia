# Bingo Game Examples

This document shows examples of the bingo cards and operator reference sheet generated by the Spotify Playlist Bingo Game Generator.

## Example Bingo Card

Each bingo card is a 5x5 grid (configurable from 3x3 to 7x7) with songs from your Spotify playlist. Every card has a unique index number for tracking.

**Reference Sheet Features:**
- **Card Index**: Unique identifier for each card
- **Win Round**: The round number when the card wins
- **Win Type**: How the card wins (Row, Column, or Diagonal)
- **Place**: Winner ranking with medal indicators
  - 🥇 1st Place (highlighted in gold)
  - 🥈 2nd Place (highlighted in light orange)
  - 🥉 3rd Place (highlighted in light red)
- **Song Called**: The song that completed the winning pattern

**How to Use:**
1. Print all bingo cards and distribute to players
2. Keep the operator reference sheet for yourself
3. Call songs from the playlist in random order
4. Watch for the predicted wins to occur
5. Award prizes to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners

## Game Flow Example

Based on the example above:

1. **Round 12**: Card #9 wins 1st place with Row 3 when "Imagine - John Lennon" is called
2. **Round 13**: Card #2 wins 2nd place with Column 4 when "Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin" is called
3. **Round 14**: Card #5 wins 3rd place with Diagonal (TR-BL) when "One - U2" is called
4. Remaining cards continue winning through Round 22

## Notes

- The game simulation uses random song ordering, so each generation will produce different results
- Win detection works for:
  - All 5 rows
  - All 5 columns
  - Both diagonals (top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left)
- The operator table can be downloaded as CSV for printing or sharing
- Each card is guaranteed to be unique with different song arrangements
